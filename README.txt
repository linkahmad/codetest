Do at least ONE of the following tasks: refactor is mandatory. Write tests is optional, will be good bonus to see it. 
Please do not invest more than 2-4 hours on this.
Upload your results to a Github repo, for easier sharing and reviewing.

Thank you and good luck!



Code to refactor
=================
1) app/Http/Controllers/BookingController.php
2) app/Repository/BookingRepository.php

Code to write tests (optional)
=====================
3) App/Helpers/TeHelper.php method willExpireAt
4) App/Repository/UserRepository.php, method createOrUpdate


----------------------------

What I expect in your repo:

X. A readme with:   Your thoughts about the code. What makes it amazing code. Or what makes it ok code. Or what makes it terrible code. How would you have done it. Thoughts on formatting, structure, logic.. The more details that you can provide about the code (what's terrible about it or/and what is good about it) the easier for us to assess your coding style, mentality etc

And 

Overall Thoughts
===================
The provided code has room for improvement in terms of formatting, structure,comments on strong logic. While it accomplishes its functionality, there are areas that could be enhanced to improve readability, maintainability, and adherence to coding best practices.

Strengths
=============
The code follows a modular approach by utilizing a repository pattern, which helps separate data access logic from the controller.
It leverages Laravel's request object to handle incoming HTTP requests.
The code incorporates conditional checks to determine the appropriate response based on user roles.

Areas for Improvement
=========================
The code lacks consistent formatting, making it harder to read and understand. Proper indentation, spacing, and consistent use of braces can greatly enhance code readability.
There are instances where magic values are used directly in the code (e.g., 'true', 'false'). It would be better to define these values as constants or use boolean literals (true/false) for improved clarity.
The code uses env to access configuration values. It is recommended to utilize Laravel's config function to access configuration values consistently throughout the application.
There is some duplication of code in different methods. Extracting common functionality into reusable helper methods or consolidating code can help reduce duplication and improve maintainability.
Error Handling: The code lacks proper error handling and exception handling. It's important to implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle exceptions and provide meaningful error messages to the users.
Consistent Naming Conventions: The code should follow consistent naming conventions for variables, methods, and classes. This will make the code more cohesive and easier to understand.
The code could benefit from inline documentation, especially for complex logic or non-obvious functionality. Properly documented code makes it easier for developers to understand and maintain the codebase.
Refactoring Suggestions

Here are some refactoring suggestions based on the code provided:
======================================================================
Utilize Laravel's config function to access configuration values instead of using env directly.
Identify and extract common functionality into reusable helper methods to reduce code duplication.
Implement proper error handling and exception handling to gracefully handle errors and provide meaningful error messages to users.
Ensure consistent naming conventions for variables, methods, and classes.
Add inline documentation to clarify the purpose of the code and improve maintainability.
By addressing these areas, the code can become more readable, maintainable, and adhere to coding best practices.

Y.  Refactor it if you feel it needs refactoring. The more love you put into it. The easier for us to asses your thoughts, code principles etc


IMPORTANT: Make two commits. First commit with original code. Second with your refactor so we can easily trace changes. 


NB: you do not need to set up the code on local and make the web app run. It will not run as its not a complete web app. This is purely to assess you thoughts about code, formatting, logic etc


===== So expected output is a GitHub link with either =====

1. Readme described above (point X above) + refactored code 
OR
2. Readme described above (point X above) + refactored core + a unit test of the code that we have sent

Thank you!
